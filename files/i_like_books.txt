I like books. Whenever someone asks me what my favourite hobby is, I say: "I like reading books". 

I read books of many different genres, but my favourites are the classics. Dickens, Dostoevsky, Austen, 
and Shakespeare are but some of the many greats that I have read. 

I read books in many different forms. Physical copies, e-books, and even audio books (I'm not sure if that counts)!

Both fiction and non-fiction books can teach one many different things about the world. I believe that fictional books can 
teach us empathy and give us a sense of what life was like in a different time and place. Fantasy and sci-fi can 
transport us into worlds that are quite unimaginable. Where would we be without Middle Earth and Hogwarts?

Biographical books can teach us that even the most successful people in history often had to deal with failures and 
frustrations along the way. I sometimes think that biographical books can be more inspiring than the very popular
"self-help" books that you find advertised in the windows of every book shop that still exists in the modern world.

I've even delved into the world of auto-biographical books (but sometimes I feel there is a bit of exaggeration and 
not-so-subtle bragging involved, so I read these with great caution). However, it can still prove useful to get a glimpse into
the mind of the person whose auto-biography you are reading.

If ever I get tasked with giving a young person some superficial advice, I'll say to them: "Take a break from social media, and
read a good book!"

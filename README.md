This is a simple application which showcases some of the basic methods in the `python` language. In order to see it in effect, navigate to the folder `simple-book-finder`, and then run 
```python
python dictionary-of-books-py
```

or 
```python
python list-of-books.py
```

In the latter, you will be asked which book you would like. You will get a positive or negative response depending on whether or not the book exists in the list.
